# Uman 1975 Fields Calculation

This is a set of MATLAB functions which allow you to reproduce the results of the paper: "The Electromagnetic Radiation from a Finite Antenna", Uman, Martin A.; McLain, D. Kenneth; Krider, E. Philip.

There are three main functions, which create the return-stroke current used in the paper, and calculate the magnetic and electric fields by means of numerical integraion, using Equations (7) and (9) from the paper.
